 ## Description
- Started a new course on **PCB design** which includes the revision of electronics as a whole in general.
- This course involves the designing of PCBs in the circuit maker software.

 - **Electronics** is derived from the word **electron**
 - There are two branches :
   ```mermaid
     graph TD;
     Electronics-->Analog
     Electronics-->Digital
   ```
 - **Analog Electronics** is a branch of electronics that deals with the time-varying electrical signals whereas **Digital Electronics** deals with data that is binary in the forms of 0's and 1's.
 - A multimeter is a low-cost all-in-one meter that measures various parameters such as voltage, current, frequency, test diodes, passive component values, and so on.
 - Some of the passive components are :

   Passive-->Resistor
   Passive-->Capacitor
   Passive-->Inductor
   ```
- **Digital Electronics** is a two-state logic (0 or 1). Digital systems always approximate the output.
- The International System of Units or **SI Unit** is the widely accepted measurement unit.
-  *Scientific Notation* is the standard way of writing numbers in mathematics.
-  All components in digital electronics are in terms of *Integrated Circuits*.

 - **Atomic Weight** = Number of protons + Number of neutrons
 - *Electrons* are the negatively charged carriers and *holes* are the positively charged carriers.
 - Electron flow results in a current flow called **electron current** and the current that results from the flow of holes is called **conventional current**.
 - **Current** is defined as the amount of charge flowing per unit of time,i.e
          $`
            I=Q/C
   `$
 - Current flows from *higher potential* to *lower potential* (from (+) to (-)).Current comes out of the higher potential.
 - The power expression is given by $` P=V*I `$.
 - **Voltage** is defined as potential energy per unit charge i.e $` 1V=1 J/1 C `$.
 - The positive Part of the battery is *anode* and the negative part of the battery is the *cathode*.
 - If we interchange the leads of measurement like cathode to + and anode to - then we are measuring the negative voltage.
 - In the series connection of the batteries the current flowing through all remains the same and the voltage gets added up, whereas in parallel the current gets divided and voltages remain the same.
 - DC motors, attenuators, etc works on the principle of Electromagnetic induction given  by Micheal Faraday.
 - Photoelectric effect by Albert Einstein. Photon energy causes the excitation of electrons i.e $` E(ev)=h*v `$ where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and v is the frequency that is given by $` v= c/ lambda `$
 - Types of  dependent sources
   ```mermaid

      Dependent-->VCVS
      Dependent-->CCVS
      Dependent-->VCCS
      Dependent-->CCCS
   ``` 
 - A current that varies as a function of time is called as **Alternating Current**.
 - Root Mean Square (RMS) value of voltage = $` Vrms=Vm/2 `$
 - $` Vpp=2\sqrt{2} *Vrms `$ is the peak to peak voltage.
 - **Ohm's Law** states that "Voltage is proportional to the current that is independent of the process parameters."
   $` V=I*R `$
 - Power is defined as the rate of change in energy.
   $` P=V*dQ/dt `$
 - Instantaneous Power in the steady-state AC circuit is given by
   $` Pmax= Imax*Vmax `$
 - Maximum Instantaneous Power in the steady AC circuit is given by
   $` Pmax= Vp*Ip*cos(phi) `$
