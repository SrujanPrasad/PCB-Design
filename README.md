 ## Description
- Started a new course on **PCB design** which includes the revision of electronics as a whole in general.
- This course involves the designing of PCBs in the circuit maker software.

 - **Electronics** is derived from the word **electron**
 - There are two branches :
   ```mermaid
     graph TD;
     Electronics-->Analog
     Electronics-->Digital
   ```
 - **Analog Electronics** is a branch of electronics that deals with the time-varying electrical signals whereas **Digital Electronics** deals with data that is binary in the forms of 0's and 1's.
 - A multimeter is a low-cost all-in-one meter that measures various parameters such as voltage, current, frequency, test diodes, passive component values, and so on.
 - Some of the passive components are :
   ```mermaid

   Passive-->Resistor
   Passive-->Capacitor
   Passive-->Inductor
   ```
- **Digital Electronics** is a two-state logic (0 or 1). Digital systems always approximate the output.
- The International System of Units or **SI Unit** is the widely accepted measurement unit.
-  *Scientific Notation* is the standard way of writing numbers in mathematics.
-  All components in digital electronics are in terms of *Integrated Circuits*.

 - **Atomic Weight** = Number of protons + Number of neutrons
 - *Electrons* are the negatively charged carriers and *holes* are the positively charged carriers.
 - Electron flow results in a current flow called **electron current** and the current that results from the flow of holes is called **conventional current**.
 - **Current** is defined as the amount of charge flowing per unit of time,i.e
          $`
            I=Q/C
   `$
 - Current flows from *higher potential* to *lower potential* (from (+) to (-)).
 - The power expression is given by $` P=V*I `$.
 - **Voltage** is defined as potential energy per unit charge i.e $` 1V=1 J/1 C `$.
